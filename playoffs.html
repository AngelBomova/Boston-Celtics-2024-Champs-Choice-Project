                <h2 class="indextext4">
                    The Boston Celtics will beat the LA Clippers in the 2024 NBA Finals in a 7 game series. Jayson Tatum will be crowned the finals MVP and the Celtics will officially have the most Championships in the NBA. Many factors lead me to believe that the Celtics will take it all. To start, they have the best offensive rating in the league, and they have the second highest defensive rating. So they can do it on both sides of the court being well rounded. On top of this, they have one of the best duos in the league with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown who are both elite scorers and great defenders. On top of this, we have other essential pieces such as Jrue Holiday who is one of the best point guard defenders, Derrick White who is arguably the most underrated player in the league, and Kristaps Porziņģis who produces a lot on the offensive side. The Celtics also have Payton Pritchard who is a spark off the bench and Al Hoford who is a solid bigman and brings a veteran presence to the team. On top of this, the Celtics have been contenders which feels for awhile now, making the Eastern Conference Finals to 5 out of the 7 past seasons and even making it to the finals in 2022. This year is different from others because their new additions with Jrue Holiday and KP not only keep their defense good if not better, but also bring more offensive firepower that they could have used in other years. One of the Celtics few weaknesses include not having a good big defender, but I think all the benefits outweigh that problem. <u>Celtics in 7.</u>
